# What's this?

This is an ES6 re-implementation of [jQuery-menu-aim](https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim) by [Ben Kamens](https://github.com/kamens).

It has been written so that it can be used/imported as a regular ES6 module ... like so:

```javascript
import { MenuAim } from 'es6-menu-aim';

let mAim = new MenuAim('');
```

Unlike the original *jQuery-menu-aim*, this one doesn't use jQuery ... in fact it has no dependencies.

## Why would I want use this?

The use case for menu aim is best described in README of the original [jQuery-menu-aim](https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim).

You might want to use this one over the original 
## How to install?

Simply open up a terminal, go to your project directory and run:
```
npm i --save es6-menu-aim
```
